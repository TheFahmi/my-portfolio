# Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses Nodemailer to send emails. To set it up:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (use `.env.example` as a template)
2. Configure your SMTP settings:

```env
# SMTP Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Contact Email (where to receive messages)
CONTACT_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
```

### Using Gmail

If you're using Gmail, you'll need to:

1. Enable 2-Step Verification in your Google account
2. Generate an App Password: Google Account → Security → App Passwords
3. Use that App Password in your `.env.local` file

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### Environment Variables on Vercel

Don't forget to add your SMTP configuration as environment variables in your Vercel project settings.
